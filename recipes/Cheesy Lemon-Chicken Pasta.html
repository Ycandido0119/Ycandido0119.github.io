    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 

    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
      <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed and softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, adding frozen peas during the last 2 minutes of cooking time. Drain pasta and peas, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and onion; cook until mushrooms are brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook in the same skillet over medium-high heat until browned and no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms back to the skillet. Add cream cheese, lemon juice, and lemon zest; stir until cream cheese is melted. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Fold in Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses, then parsley. Toss with pasta and peas, adding reserved cooking liquid as necessary to make a sauce.</li>
    </ol>
